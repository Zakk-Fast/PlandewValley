planner footer should probably have a help button.

very bottom of a page should have the legal mumbo jump. probably be a global footer for the layout.

---- crop planner grid... thing ----
Users selects add a card, then a modal pops up. They select preset or custom.
if it's a preset, then they chose the spinkler type and how many.
if it's a custom, the choose the total number tiles.
they then can add fertilizer.

once those options are chosen, the card is generated and the modal is exited.

from there they can then add another card or drag and drop a crop onto the card.
if they drag a crop, they are then asked how many plots to fill with the crop (and a fill all button)
